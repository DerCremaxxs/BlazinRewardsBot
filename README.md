&#x1F534;  **NOTICE** - This promotion is ONLY available in the United States! Other regions may have issues with this program crashing because of this.

### Usage
Visit the release tab for this repo to download a compiled version of this project: https://github.com/Tustin/BlazinRewardsBot/releases

Or you can build it yourself using Visual Studio 2017.

### Issues
* Some codes may fail to be automatically fetched from the email. If that happens, simply follow these steps:
  1) Take email output by program and go here: https://temp-mail.org/en/option/change/
  2) Enter the email and save it, then go here: https://temp-mail.org/en/
  3) You should have an email with your double xp code
  
* You can only redeem about 40 or 50 codes per Call of Duty account. You'll most likely start getting redeem errors if you do more than that.
